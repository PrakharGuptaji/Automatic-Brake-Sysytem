# Automatic-Brake-Sysytem
We generally come across many road accident cases which are caused due to carelessness of not applying brakes at the correct time by the driver.
To solve this issue, I have made an "Automatic Braking System" using ARDUINO UNO and some sensors which will apply brakes appropriately such that the vehicle will stop just before the obstacle so as to prevent an accident.

Components used:

1. Motor and wheel
2. Distance sensor(HC-SR04):-For measuring the distance of the obstacle from the setup.
3. Servo Motor:-To command the  application of brakes
4. Speed Measuring Sensor:-To measure the rotating speed of the wheel
5. 2 LEDs:-For alarming the application of brakes by the Arduino system
 AND A BRAKING MECHANISM

Working, ARDUINO code, block diagram and video of this system is attached in this repository.
